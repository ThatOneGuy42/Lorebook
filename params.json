{"name":"The Lore Book","tagline":"This is the Lore Wiki for BS12.","body":"# Welcome to Lore Book\r\nAs you have noticed from the title, this is the repository for the Lore of Baystation. \"But TOG, if there's already a wiki, why do we need this?\" Well I'll tell you! The setup the Lore had on the wiki was extremely decentralized, and...well, pretty bad, with pages all over place, and surrounded by other articles, a lot of it was never touched. The idea for GitWiki came up a while ago (from the great mind of Boop), and after I took over as Loremaster, I decided to start this.\r\n\r\n## This Is Not the Wiki\r\nI will repeat, this is not the wiki. There are no guidelines, rules, policies, guides to jobs, staff ranking. This is simply a centralized, (hopefully well done), repository for Our (Baystation) lore. The Wiki, for that type of information, is located here: https://wiki.baystation12.net/Main_Page\r\n\r\n___\r\n### Actual Rules for This Lore Book\r\nMake sure to edit, and clean your documents before submitting it for adding. I, and the Wiki/Lore Maintainers, will dig through your additions until they are well written and fitting with the writing style of the rest of the Book. Read over some of the other files to see what I'm talking about, and please to god, learn how to use Git Markdown. Thanks again!\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n## Chapters\r\nThese are the \"Chapters\" of the Lore Book. Each one is a different category of the lore, and is full of pages related to that category. \r\n\r\n* Welcome to the Milky Way, Circa 2560\r\n* Humans, Aliens, and Monsters ohmy! \r\n* So You Want To Go Corporate?\r\n* Colonies, From Mining Hubs to New New New York!\r\n* Terrorism and You!\r\n* Glossary of Terms\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
